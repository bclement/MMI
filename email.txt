Here is the github for the code. Sorry I didn't get it checked in
earlier today.

The basic flow of the program is that a session file is read in (example
in src/test/resources) and those images are displayed with sounds in
intervals.

Basic needs: a GUI to wrap the displayed images and provide buttons that
will score the response. There is a boolean value for 'attending' that
just notes if the child was looking at the prompter. The real meat is
the response value. This can be 1 of 4 things: independent (child
answered before the prompt audio), verbal (child answered after the
prompt but before the answer), modeling (child answered anytime after
the answer audio) or the child did not answer.

I have a basic stats input and processing class. I was planning on doing
the output in CSV so they can slurp it into excel. BTW I need to add an
output location to the session config.

Right now it just blasts through the item list from the config using the
second time delay again. This needs to stay on the image until the user
scores the item. Once all the items from the session config are done,
then we can display/save(csv) the results.

Bonus: the GUI could do the job of CRUDing the session configs.

We can chat about it throughout the week. The deadline is soft and
created by myself. I don't know if there is a hard deadline, but the
sooner we get it wrapped up the better.
