MainGui is the entry point for the program that's used during the studies.

CrudFrame is the entry point for the CRUD program Brian asked for.

5/25/11 Payne@MattPayne.org changed example session file so it has paths that are absolute paths.   
The paths originally started out 
with paths that were relative to the base directory of the maven project.


TODO: 
1) DONE: MainGui should size to the biggest image
2) CrudFrame should populate the images and audio files in a session
3) The menus should have shortcuts where needed
4) Clean all TODOs from code
5) JNLP the whole thing and make it so we can load session.zip files from HTTP
6) Build some sample datasets while testing on Windows boxes in the UNOmaha.edu user room
